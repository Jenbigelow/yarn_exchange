<h1>Yarn Stash Exchange</h1>
<p>Yarn Stash Exchange is a secondhand marketplace that uses data from Ravelry, the most popular knitting and crocheting website, to gather yarns that Ravelry users want to sell. Ravelry’s stash feature allows users to track their yarns, but when they want to sell, they can only tag the yarn as “will trade or sell” and the price is hidden in the notes component. By using Ravelry’s API, the relevant pricing data is extracted using a custom search algorithm. The webapp allows users to filter the yarns by price and yarn weight and uses React for a fast and responsive user experience. Users can find yarns that fit their needs quickly, and find out all yarns available for sale by a seller and the sellers location. By signing in, the user can store favorited yarns, which show up on a convenient list on the user’s favorites page.</p>
